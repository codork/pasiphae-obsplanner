PASIPHAE (Polar-Areas Stellar-Imaging in Polarization High-Accuracy Experiment) aims to map, with unprecedented accuracy, the polarization of millions of stars at areas of the sky away from the Galactic plane, in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres. Combined with stellar distances provided by ESA’s Gaia mission, this data will allow us, for the very first time, to construct a tomographic map of the Galactic magnetic field. Our ultimate goal: to clear the path towards the detection of the imprint of inflation on primordial light.

The experiment is set to take place at the Skinakas Observatory, Crete, and the South African Astronomical Observatory in Sutherland, South Africa.

PASIPHAE (named after the Minoan Queen) is a collaborative effort of the Astrophysics Group in Crete (the joint Astrophysics group at the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas, the Institute of Theoretical and Computational Physics, the University of Crete, and the Skinakas Observatory) with the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India (the world’s foremost laboratory of optopolarimeter design and development), the South African Astronomical Observatory, the California Institute of Technology in the US (including the Caltech Optical Observatories and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory), and the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo.
